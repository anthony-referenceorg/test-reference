Diplodocus, genus of dinosaurs of the suborder Sauropoda. One of the largest of the dinosaurs, it lived during the Jurassic period, inhabiting the western part of what is now the United States. Fossil specimens indicate that the reptile attained lengths of up to 26.5 m (87 ft). It was relatively slender, however, and somewhat less bulky than the related Apatosaurus. Diplodocus was a quadruped with a long neck, a low body, and a long tail. A vegetarian, it had a small head with slender teeth and probably grazed in marshes and shallow water.
